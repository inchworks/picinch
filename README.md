## Features
PicInch makes an image-oriented website. Optionally it provides a simple way for a group of website members, such as a photography club, to share their photographs. The emphasis is on uncluttered presentation of images, organised into slideshows.

Information pages and menu items can be added and edited, making PicInch a full-featured website. The aim is to make website editing as simple as possible, not to provide precise control of the website appearance.

Three options are provided:
- Club mode shows slideshows attributed to individual contributors.
- Solo mode makes an image-oriented website for images by a single owner.
- Competition mode makes a standalone host for a public photo competition.

PicInch is written in Go and ready to be deployed to a virtual machine using Docker, for good performance and easy setup. Support for HTTPS is automatic, using Let’s Encrypt certificates.
