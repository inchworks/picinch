# PicInch Gallery
PicInch provides a simple way for a group of website members, such as a photography club, to share their photographs. The emphasis is on uncluttered presentation of images, organised into slideshows.

- Contributors create simple slideshows. Each slide has a selection of title, photo and caption. Slides adjust in layout to match the content. There is a basic facility to edit and reorder slides.

- Slideshows may be organised into topics. Topics may be defined in advance, or applied to existing slideshows. A topic can be viewed as a single slideshow, or as a page listing the individual contributions.

- Sign-up is restricted to a pre-set list of members, suitable for a club.

- Slideshows can be specified as publicly visible, or visible to website users, or hidden.

- Individual photos can be added to a special topic “Highlights”, featured on the home page. It includes just the most recent highlights from each contributor.

- The home page shows the most recent highlights and slideshows for each user. The numbers of each shown are configurable. A page for each contributor shows all their highlights and slideshows.

- Written in Go and may be deployed to a virtual machine using Docker, giving good performance, and easy setup.
