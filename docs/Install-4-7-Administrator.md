**Guide to Admin**
## Administrator Changes
If the admin password is lost, add a username and password for a *new* administrator and restart the server. You can then log in and reset the old administrator’s status to “known”, to keep their photos and allow them to sign-up with a new password. Or you can delete the old administrator.
